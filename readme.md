# Go-WebSocket

This project purposedly created to explore more about websocket and to decide whether to use a custom websocket or we can just use firebase realtime-database

After much consideration i think creating custom websocket server is not suitable when we want to start the development in fast paced

Custom websocket server sure is great if we want something that is unique and want to put our business requirement in it, but if we seek the development speed, i think it is better to use something like firebase realtime-database.
